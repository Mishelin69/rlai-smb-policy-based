have multilple streams on diff threads
on the main thread complete the same calculations as the other threads
and wait for all the streams to finish then pick prediction
so basically pseudo code:

//main thread

for stream in streams:
    job(..., stream)

main_thread_job

for stream in streams:
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream)

//now pick actions and stuff thats why its separate :)
